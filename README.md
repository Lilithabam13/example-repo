Hi All. This is program calculate the sum of numbers in a list recursively

# Sum of numbers in a list recursively

## Description
The program calculates sum of numbers in a list, up to and including the speciified index point using **recursion**.
It performs **input validation** to ensure all user inputs are valid integers and the index point is not out of range meaning the index point is more 
than the length of the list.

# How it works
1. Enter how many integers(numbers) will be in the list.
2. Prompt user to enter integers one-by-one.
3. A final populated list is then displayed
4. The user then enter an index point (Eg. 0, 1, 2 etc.) - sum will be calculated from this 'range'/point of the list.
5. adding_up() function is then used to caluculate sum of integers in the final list up to and
   including the element(number) at the index point**recursively**.

# Example
Please enter the desired number of integers in your list: 3
Please enter the integers into the list: 2
Please enter the integers into the list: 4
Please enter the integers into the list: 6
[2, 4, 6]
Please enter single index point: 1
The sum is equal to = 6
